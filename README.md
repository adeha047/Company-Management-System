I added JS files for each employee to add to the list. 
I added class functions for each employee added to the list. 
I then created Javascript file that ran through prompts with node inquirer. 
I added regular expressions to account for the email address requested for each employee. 
I used the node jest package to test that each js file passed inspection. 
I added gifs for each automation run from each employee.
I then added screenshots of the team.html file.
